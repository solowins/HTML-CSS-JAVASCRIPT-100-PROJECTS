It seems like you're using JavaScript to create a simple search functionality. Let me explain what each part of your code does:

```javascript
const p = document.getElementById("p");
const searchBtn = document.getElementById("searchBtn");
```
These lines retrieve references to HTML elements with the IDs "p" and "searchBtn", respectively. The assumption here is that you have an HTML element with the ID "p" (probably a paragraph element) and another element with the ID "searchBtn" (probably a button).

```javascript
searchBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  let input = document.getElementById("input").value;
```
This part adds an event listener to the "searchBtn" button. When the button is clicked, it retrieves the value entered into the input field with the ID "input".

```javascript
  if (input !== "") {
```
This conditional statement checks if the input value is not empty.

```javascript
    let regExp = new RegExp(input, "gi");
```
Here, a regular expression (`RegExp`) is created using the input value. The "gi" flags indicate that the search should be global (find all matches) and case-insensitive.

```javascript
    p.innerHTML = p.textContent.replace(regExp, "<mark>$&</mark>");
```
Finally, this line replaces the text content of the element with ID "p" with the same content but with matches of the regular expression wrapped in `<mark>` tags. `$&` is a special token in the replacement string that represents the matched substring.

This code essentially searches for the input text within the content of the element with ID "p" and highlights all occurrences of the input text when the button is clicked.



Certainly! Here are some common regular expressions along with explanations for each:

\d
Matches any digit character (0-9).
For example, \d would match any single digit.
\w
Matches any word character (alphanumeric character plus underscore).
For example, \w would match any single alphanumeric character or underscore.
\s
Matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, line breaks).
For example, \s would match any single whitespace character.
.
Matches any single character except for line breaks.
For example, . would match any single character, such as "a", "1", or "%".
\b
Matches a word boundary, such as the position between a word character (\w) and a non-word character (\W).
For example, \bword\b would match the word "word" only when it appears as a separate word, not as part of another word.
^
Matches the start of a string.
For example, ^hello would match "hello" only if it appears at the beginning of a string.
$
Matches the end of a string.
For example, world$ would match "world" only if it appears at the end of a string.
[ ]
Matches any one of the characters inside the square brackets.
For example, [abc] would match either "a", "b", or "c".
[^ ]
Matches any character NOT inside the square brackets.
For example, [^0-9] would match any character that is not a digit.
\d+
Matches one or more consecutive digits.
For example, \d+ would match "123" in the string "abc123def".
\w+
Matches one or more consecutive word characters.
For example, \w+ would match "hello" in the string "hello_world".
\s+
Matches one or more consecutive whitespace characters.
For example, \s+ would match multiple spaces or tabs in a row.
These are just a few examples of common regular expressions. Regular expressions can be combined and modified in various ways to create more complex patterns for matching text.
